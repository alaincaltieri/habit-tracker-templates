I'm trying to create a header image for a blog post titled "What the heck is a habit tracker and how should you use it?". Can you give me some creative ideas and generate a few images for me? 

The style should be illustration. Preferably black and white, with just one or two colors (RED and YELLOW).

The image should display a stressed woman smoking a cigarette while scrolling on a smartphone. She is sitting on the sidewalk of an empty street, with condos behind her. The style must be pencil illustration, with predominant colors being black and accent colors in red and blue. The purpose of the image is to serve as a high quality and evocative blog header.

Crea una immagine. L'immagine mostra del terreno su cui stanno germogliando delle piantine. Si vede un raggio di sole colpire una parte del campo. Le piantine sono di grandezza diversa e sullo sfondo s'intravedono piante adulte. Usa lo stile graphic novel, con solo toni bianco e nero ma colora le piante di un verde acceso per metterle in evidenza. L'immagine dev'essere di alta qualità e verrà usata come header per un blog.
