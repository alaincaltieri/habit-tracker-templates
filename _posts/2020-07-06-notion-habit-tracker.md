# A quick alternative: Habit tracker apps

While a Notion Habit Tracker is a powerful tool, it's not everyone's cup of tea. Let's spill the beans on why it might not be your perfect match.

Firstly, managing an Habit Tracker on Notion can be tricky. It's not just about ticking off boxes; it's about setting it up, maintaining it, and making sure it serves your needs. And if you're not tech-savvy, it can feel like trying to solve a puzzle in the dark.

Secondly, creating graphs in Notion can be really challenging. It's not built for data visualization, so if you're a fan of colorful graphs and charts, you might find yourself in a pickle.

Thirdly, dealing with data, sync, and backups in Notion can be as frustrating. If you're not careful, you might end up with lost data or sync issues, which is about as fun as stepping on a Lego.

And, as I said early, Notion is an all-in-one workspace, which means it can be overwhelming.

But don't worry, there's a silver lining. If you're looking for a user-friendly alternative, the [Habituator habit tracker](https://apple.co/3PqueKO) app on iOS is your knight in shining armor. It's designed specifically for habit tracking, so it's as easy to use as a light switch. Plus, it takes care of the graphs, data, and backups, so you can focus on what really matters - your habits. So, before continuing, why not give Habituator a whirl? You might just find it's the perfect fit for you!
